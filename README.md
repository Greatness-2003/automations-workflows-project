# Sitcom Sentiment Analysis 

The goal of the project is to develop a sentiment analysis tool to analyze Twitter data related to popular TV shows, specifically sitcoms (HIMYM, Modern Family, etc). The goal is to collect, process, and analyze tweets, comments, and posts from Twitter to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of the audience's reactions to different TV shows.
